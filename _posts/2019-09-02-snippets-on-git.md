When starting Git and Github, I was very confused and frustrated as there are so many tutorials but you really do not know where to start. I couldnot find any tutorial sources that are comprehensive yet plainly-presented for such a newbie like me. Have to say, I also suck at reading long and complicated stuff. For me to learn, I prefer "going straight to the point" style, kind of condensed and featured with lots of visualization, like mapping or listing in form of bullet points. Therefore, I created this post, first of all, for me, to have an organized bookmark of knowledge on Git and Github; second, for any friends, who are kind and generous enough to enlighten me, to be able to do it; and finally, for any newbies like me, to have a naive yet helpful reference.

I think one of my problems when approaching Github is that I overcomplicated it. While in fact, if you just think of Github as Dropbox or Google Drive but with some tracking of your activities (which is called version control), everything will be much more easier to absorb. For example, when you make changes on a local file, you need to push it in order to sync it with the online repository (or I would call it "online folder"). Unlike GG Drive or Dropbox, when you change, it is automatically changed. 

# Step 1: Create an account on Github
Just like other Cloud storage website, by following this [link](https://github.com/join)
# Step 2: Install Git or Github Desktop 
##### Git
If you are familiar with making command line on stuff like Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows and the like, you might want to install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then you will you use pre-determined git commands to sync your work back and fourth. 
##### Git Desktop 
On the other hand, if you do not prefer that alient language of command lines like me, you still can do great on Github by installing [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) - a seamless point-and-click application to do version controlling on Github. 
# Step 3: Do it!
##### 1. Sync local files to online repository 
From step 1 to this part of step 3, I would highly recommend these two posts from ReadWrite website.
